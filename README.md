### Day 3: October 18, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum using pointers.

**Thoughts:** Worked on time blocking my week, and nearly forgot about the challenge today. Translating this code form JS to Python was very difficult for me.

### Day 2: October 17, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a hash table.

**Thoughts:** Struggled making time for the challenge today - It's been a busy weekend. I'll time block the week tomorrow morning.

### Day 1: October 16, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a for loop. Decided I should also try the same solve in Python.

**Thoughts:** I've been working in JavaScript for awhile, and want to improve, and I think I also want learn more about Python. After I solve the challenge in JavaScript, I'll try take the rest of my time and see how far I can get translating it into Python.

### Day 0: October 15, 2021

**Today's Progress** Setting up. Reading through the Two Number Sum challenge.

**Thoughts:** It was a struggle thinking about how I want to organize my files now that I'm out of class. I deleted a repo unnecessarily. Eh, it's all good now.
