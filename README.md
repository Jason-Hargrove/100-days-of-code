### Day 12: October 27, 2021

**Today's Progress** Added open graph meta tags to all projects. Troubleshot SSH and branch issues with GitHub.

**Thoughts:** A roller coaster morning. It's works, but broke something else fixing it. Updated one thing, got to update all the other apps.

### Day 11: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress** Binary Search Tree Construction implemented iteratively. Can insert or search for nodes, but not remove at the moment.

**Thoughts:** A subject I've felt apprehensive about. Turned out to be fun! The removal part is difficult, and I haven't got my head wrapped around it yet.

### Day 10: October 25, 2021

**Today's Progress** MDN A re-introduction to JavaScript. Partway through.

**Thoughts:** A slight detour form coding challenges this morning - glad I did. Rediscovered a couple things I had totally forgotten about, and one thing I wish I had known about from the beginning.

### Day 7: October 22, 2021

**Today's Progress** Sorted Squared Array solved in liner time, sorted in ascending order.

### Day 6: October 20, 2021

**Today's Progress** Solved Sorted Squared Array using brute force.

**Thoughts:** Working on coding challenges first thing in the morning is the way to go. I need to work on some art today, and I have time blocked to start a small React project tonight.

### Day 5: October 20, 2021

**Today's Progress** Solved Validate Subsequence using a for of loop.

**Thoughts:** If I finish a bit early - like I did on this one - and don't need to study deeper, I should spend the rest of my time on the whiteboard.

### Day 4: October 19, 2021

**Today's Progress** Solved Validate Subsequence using a while loop and pointers.

**Thoughts:** Got to it first thing this morning. It feels good having it out of the way.

### Day 3: October 18, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum using pointers.

**Thoughts:** Worked on time blocking my week, and nearly forgot about the challenge today. Translating this code form JS to Python was very difficult for me.

### Day 2: October 17, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a hash table.

**Thoughts:** Struggled making time for the challenge today - It's been a busy weekend. I'll time block the week tomorrow morning.

### Day 1: October 16, 2021

**Today's Progress** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a for loop. Decided I should also try the same solve in Python.

**Thoughts:** I've been working in JavaScript for awhile, and want to improve, and I think I also want learn more about Python. After I solve the challenge in JavaScript, I'll try take the rest of my time and see how far I can get translating it into Python.

### Day 0: October 15, 2021

**Today's Progress** Setting up. Reading through the Two Number Sum challenge.

**Thoughts:** It was a struggle thinking about how I want to organize my files now that I'm out of class. I deleted a repo unnecessarily. Eh, it's all good now.
