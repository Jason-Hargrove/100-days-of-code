### Day 17: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** MDN A re-introduction to JavaScript. Variables, operators and scope.

**Thoughts:** I keep learning things I'd forgotten with the MDN re-intro. Unplanned priorities came up this morning - couldn't code first thing. Replanning my week now.

### Day 16: October 31, 2021

**Today's Progress:** MDN A re-introduction to JavaScript. Strings and other types.

**Thoughts:** This was good for me and fun. Even though I blocked time for coding today, it was very challenging to get started with all the Halloween stuff going on. Got it done!

### Day 15: October 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Find Closest Value in a BST. Solved recursively and iteratively.

**Thoughts:** It's gloomy and cold. Got a late start today and I don't regret it.

### Day 14: October 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Find Closest Value in a BST. Haven't go it to work yet. Solving recursively.

**Thoughts:** I went over my allotted time today. I'll pick it back up in the morning. Nope, it's not working right - not working at all.

### Day 13: October 28, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Binary Search Tree Construction. Insert, search and remove.

**Thoughts:** Finally solved remove. It took a walkthrough, searching the web for examples, and an hour of troubleshooting.

### Day 12: October 27, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Added open graph meta tags to all projects. Troubleshot SSH and branch issues with GitHub.

**Thoughts:** A roller coaster morning. It's works, but broke something else fixing it. Updated one thing, got to update all the other apps.

### Day 11: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Binary Search Tree Construction implemented iteratively. Can insert or search for nodes, but not remove at the moment.

**Thoughts:** A subject I've felt apprehensive about. Turned out to be fun! The removal part is difficult, and I haven't got my head wrapped around it yet.

### Day 10: October 25, 2021

**Today's Progress:** MDN A re-introduction to JavaScript. Partway through.

**Thoughts:** A slight detour form coding challenges this morning - glad I did. Rediscovered a couple things I had totally forgotten about, and one thing I wish I had known about from the beginning.

### Day 9: October 24, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved Non-Constructible Change.

### Day 5: October 20, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved Validate Subsequence using a for of loop.

**Thoughts:** If I finish a bit early - like I did on this one - and don't need to study deeper, I should spend the rest of my time on the whiteboard.

### Day 4: October 19, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved Validate Subsequence using a while loop and pointers.

### Day 3: October 18, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on solving Two Number Sum using pointers.

**Thoughts:** Worked on time blocking my week, and nearly forgot about the challenge today. Translating this code form JS to Python was very difficult for me.

### Day 2: October 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a hash table.

**Thoughts:** Struggled making time for the challenge today - It's been a busy weekend. I'll time block the week tomorrow morning.

### Day 1: October 16, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on solving Two Number Sum with a for loop. Decided I should also try the same solve in Python.

**Thoughts:** I've been working in JavaScript for awhile, and want to improve, and I think I also want learn more about Python. After I solve the challenge in JavaScript, I'll try take the rest of my time and see how far I can get translating it into Python.

### Day 0: October 15, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Setting up. Reading through the Two Number Sum challenge.

**Thoughts:** It was a struggle thinking about how I want to organize my files now that I'm out of class. I deleted a repo unnecessarily. Eh, it's all good now.
